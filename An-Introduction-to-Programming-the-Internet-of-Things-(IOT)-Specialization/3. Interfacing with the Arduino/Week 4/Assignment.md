### Question

Write about the design of a system that you might build for your home which uses an Arduino with a wifi shield. The system must use the wifi connection for a useful purpose in the system. The Arduino should be wired to sensors and/or actuators which help it to perform some useful task in your home.

Be sure to clearly describe the need for the wifi connection in your system.

### Answer

I would use Arduino with a Wi-Fi shield to create a Network Attached Storage by connecting the Arduino with a SSD, that can act as the personal cloud storage for my family. Now since cloud storage needs internet access, the arduino will need constant access to internet and that is where the Wi-Fi shield comes in. The shield will enable the arduino to get constant internet access, which will in turn provide instant and fast upload and download speeds for the user.

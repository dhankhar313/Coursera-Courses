TCP and IP are two separate computer network protocols.

IP is the part that obtains the address to which data is sent. TCP is responsible for data delivery once that IP address has been found.

It's possible to separate them, but there isn’t really a point in making a difference between TCP and IP. Because they're so often used together, “TCP/IP” and the “TCP/IP model” are now recognized terminology.

Think of it this way: The IP address is like the phone number assigned to your smartphone. TCP is all the technology that makes the phone ring, and that enables you to talk to someone on another phone. They are different from one another, but they are also meaningless without one another.

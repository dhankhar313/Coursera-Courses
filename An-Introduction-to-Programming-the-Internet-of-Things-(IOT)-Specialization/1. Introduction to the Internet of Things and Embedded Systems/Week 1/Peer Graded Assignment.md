## Assignment

### Identify and analyze a device that is an IoT device now, but in the past was a non-IoT device. Describe and list the features of the device. Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.

    A very common example is a television. It just used to be a screen for people to stare at, but now it can be a screen for people to talk to and interact with.

### Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.

    Past functions or the functions of a Digital TV:

    1. Could not access internet
    2. Could not install applications
    3. Limited watching or viewing content
    4. Never had a touch screen
    5. Limited resources to access like channels or stations
    6. Could not multitask
    7. Didn't have as good display

    But a smart TV can do all the above mentioned things and those are the differences between a TV of the past and a TV of the present.

### For your chosen IoT device, list any improvements or any diminishments if they exist, over the non-IOT device. Describe any limitations that are present in the new IoT version of the device.

    Improvements or new features:

    1. Can access the internet
    2. Can install and run applications
    3. Way higher watching content e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime etc.
    4. Can have a touch screen
    5. Much higher access to resources like channels or stations
    6. Can easily multitask
    7. Can have a 4k or an 8k display

### Describe any privacy issues with the IoT device that never existed in the original version of the device. Compare the price of the original device to the price of the new IoT version of the device. When performing a price comparison, attempt to normalize for the changing value of currency over time by using an online inflation calculator.

    A major privacy issue is that since the smart IoT tv is connected to the internet, it is vulnerable to hacking attempts and other various attacks. Once hacked, the hacker can access all your data through the network that your IoT device is connected to.

    Smart TV's emerged around 2010, and $1 according to that time is $1.19 in 2020. And the price at that time used to be about or under $500 whereas now a smart tv can cost well above $1000. But, it can easily be justified based on the added features and newer advancements.

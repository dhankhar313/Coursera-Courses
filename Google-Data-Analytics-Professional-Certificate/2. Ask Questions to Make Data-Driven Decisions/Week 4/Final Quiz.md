### Question

Scenario 1, questions 1-5

You’ve just started a job as a data analyst at a small software company that provides data analytics and business intelligence solutions. Your supervisor asks you to kick off a project with a new client, Athena’s Story, a feminist bookstore. They have four existing locations, and the fifth shop has just opened in your community.

Athena’s Story wants to produce a campaign to generate excitement for an upcoming celebration and introduce the bookstore to the community. They share some data with your team to help make the event as successful as possible.

Your task is to review the assignment and the available data, then present your approach to your supervisor. Click the link below to access the email from your supervisor:
Then, review the email, and the Customer Survey and Historical Sales datasets.

After reading the email, you notice that the acronym WHM appears in multiple places. You look it up online, and the most common result is web host manager. That doesn’t seem right to you, as it doesn’t fit the context of a feminist bookstore. You email your supervisor to ask. When writing your email, what do you do to ensure it sounds professional? Select all that apply.

### Answer

    Use a polite greeting and closing.
    Read your email aloud before sending to catch any typos or grammatical errors and to ensure the communication is clear.
    Respect your supervisor’s time by writing an email that’s short and to the point.

### Question

Scenario 1 continued

Now that you know WHM stands for Women’s History Month, you review the Customer Survey dataset which contains both qualitative and quantitative data.

The data in column F (Survey Q6: What types of books would you like to see more of at Athena's Story?) is quantitative.

### Answer

False

### Question

Scenario 1 continued

Next, you review the customer feedback in column F of the Customer Survey dataset.
The attribute of column F is, “Survey Q6: What types of books would you like to see more of at Athena's Story?” In order to verify that children’s literature and feminist zines are among the most popular genres, you create a visualization. This will help you clearly identify which genres are most likely to sell well during the Women’s History Month campaign.

Your visualization looks like this:

The chart you create demonstrates the percentages of each book genre that make up the whole. It’s called an area chart.

### Answer

False

### Question

Now that you’ve confirmed that children’s literature and feminist zines are among the most requested book genres, you review the Historical Sales dataset.
You’re pleased to see that the dataset contains data that’s specific to children’s literature and feminist zines. This will provide you with the information you need to make data-inspired decisions. In addition, the children’s literature and feminist zines metrics will help you organize and analyze the data about each genre in order to determine if they’re likely to be profitable.

Next, you calculate the total sales over 52 weeks for feminist zines. What is the correct syntax?

### Answer

=SUM(E2:E53)

### Question

Scenario 1 continued

After familiarizing yourself with the project and available data, you present your approach to your supervisor. You provide a scope of work, which includes important details, a schedule, and information on how you plan to prepare and validate the data. You also share some of your initial results and the pie chart you created.

In addition, you identify the problem type, or domain, for the data analysis project. You decide that the historical sales data can be used to provide insights into the types of books that will sell best during Women’s History Month this coming year. This will also enable you to determine if Athena’s Story should begin selling more children’s literature and feminist zines.

Using historical data to make informed decisions about how things may be in the future is an example of identifying themes.

### Answer

False
